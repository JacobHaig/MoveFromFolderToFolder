# What it do?   
This is a Rust program for moving files from one folder to another automatically. Once set up, movefromto will continuously check the folder's contents to see if there are files in the folder. If there are files, they will be moved to the output folder that you specified.  

## Example  
Use these commands in your terminal or command prompt  
`movefromto.exe --inputfolder "C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\Move From" --outputfolder "C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\Move To"`  
or  
`movefromto.exe -i "C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\Move From" -o "C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\Move To"`
